extends Node
class_name PlayerStates

#godot has no string enums so I am using constants in a class as an equivalent
const IDLE = "player-idle"
const WALKING = "player-walk"
const JUMPING = "player-jump"
const USEITEM = "player-use-item"
const DAMAGED = "player-damaged"
const INVINCIBLE = "player-invincibility"
const DEAD = "player-death"
